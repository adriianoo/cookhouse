# Cookhouse 😃

I started the project using basic __HTML, CSS, and JavaScript__.<br> 
However for the __login and registration system, I used the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/de/)__.

## Acceptance Criteria

Users should be able to:

- Successfully register an account and log in
- Get redirected to the landing page
- Log out of their account

<br />

## Screenshots
The user will be automatically redirected to create an account and login:

After registration, a user's information is stored in an array including their ID, name, email, and a hashed password.<br>
(A database is planned in the future)

# Future improvements ⚙️
- Database instead of array
