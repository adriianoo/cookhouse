# Cookhouse üòÉ

I started the project with using basic __HTML, CSS, and JavaScript__.<br> 
However, I completely restructured the architecture to incorporate a __login and registration system using the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/de/)__.

## Acceptance Criteria

Users should be able to:

- Successfully register an account and log in
- Use the search function to look up recipes
- Log out of their account

<br />

## Screenshots
The user will be automatically redirected to create an account and login:

After registration, a user's information is stored in an array including their ID, name, email, and a hashed password.<br>
(A database is planned in the future for more security)

When you click on the 'search' option in the navigation bar, you will be redirected to a page where you can search for recipes by entering a keyword like 'rice'.
